<h1>About Super Bikes</h1>
<p>Founded in 2021 by Chelsea Lynch, Super Bikes aims to cut all carbon emissions from standard fuel-powered motobikes by

based in Townsville, Australia, works from our workshop to ensure that all our products pass our quality checks before
they're sent to you. We ensure our process produces as little carbon emissions as possible, staying true to our carbon
neutral promise.</p>
